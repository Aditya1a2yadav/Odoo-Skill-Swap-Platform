## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a deep teal (#008080) to create a sense of trustworthiness and knowledge.
- Background color: Very light green-tinged gray (#F0F8F0). This provides a muted background that harmonizes with the primary and accent colors, while providing sufficient contrast for text readability.
- Accent color: Saturated light blue (#7FDEFF), analogous to the primary color in hue, and providing visual contrast via saturation and brightness. Use the accent color for interactive elements.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif. This is suitable for both headlines and body text.  
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro', monospaced. This will be used for displaying any code snippets.
- Consistent Icon Set: Use a unified icon set (e.g., Lucide or Heroicons) for skills, filters, and notifications to maintain a clean and cohesive design.
- Subtle Transitions: Use Framer Motion for page transitions, button interactions (scale on click), and skill tag entrance animations. Keep durations between 0.2â€“0.4s with ease-in-out curves for a smooth user experience.
